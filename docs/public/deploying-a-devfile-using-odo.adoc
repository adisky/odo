== Introduction to devfile

What is a devfile?

A https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/[devfile] is a portable file that describes your development environment. It allows for a _portable_ developmental environment without the need of reconfiguration.

With a devfile you can describe:

* The source code being used
* Development components such as IDE tools (VSCode) and application runtimes (Yarn / NPM)
* A list of pre-defined commands that can be run
* Projects to initially clone

Odo takes this devfile and transforms it into a workspace of multiple containers running on OpenShift, Kubernetes or Docker.

Devfiles are YAML files with a defined https://devfile.github.io/devfile/_attachments/api-reference.html[schema].

== Odo and devfile

Odo can now create components from devfiles as recorded in registries. Odo automatically consults the https://github.com/odo-devfiles/registry[default registry] but users can also add their own registries. Devfiles contribute new component types that users can pull to begin development immediately.

An example deployment scenario:

. `odo create` will consult the recorded devfile registries to offer the user a selection of available component types and pull down the associated `devfile.yaml` file
. `odo push` parses and then deploys the component in the following order:
 .. Parses and validates the YAML file
 .. Deploys the development environment to your OpenShift cluster
 .. Synchronizes your source code to the containers
 .. Executes any prerequisite commands

== Deploying your first devfile

[discrete]

==== Prerequisites for Openshift Cluster

* Enable experimental mode for odo. This can be done by: `odo preference set experimental true`

* Log in to a OpenShift cluster: `odo login -u developer -p developer`

* Create a project: `odo project create myproject`


==== Prerequisites for Kubernetes Cluster

* Enable experimental mode for odo. This can be done by: `odo preference set experimental true`

* Before proceeding, you must know your cluster domain name to specify host for ingress.


== Listing all available devfile components

* Before deploying your first component, have a look at what is available:

== Deploying a Java Spring Boot® component locally to Docker

In this example, we will be deploying the same Java Spring Boot® component we did earlier, but to a locally running Docker instance.

*Prerequisites:* Docker `17.05` or higher installed

. Enabling a separate push target, using the `pushtarget` preference:
